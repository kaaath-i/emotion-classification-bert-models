# Emotion Classification with Transformers

*🚧 Work in Progress - University NLP Project*

## Overview
This project compares the performance of DistilBERT and RoBERTa models for emotion classification on English text data. 
Part of my Master's coursework in Computational Linguistics.

## Models
- DistilBERT-based-cased: https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-cased
- RoBERTa-base: https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/roberta-base

## Dataset
mteb/emotion: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/emotion

## Project Status
- [x] Data preprocessing
- [x] DistilBERT implementation
- [x] RoBERTa implementation
- [x] Hyperparameter tuning
- [x] Performance comparison
- [ ] Final evaluation

## Results
*Coming soon*
